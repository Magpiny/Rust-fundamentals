/*
* FUNCTIONS:
*Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names, 
in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. 

We define a function in Rust by entering fn followed by a function name and a set of 
parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

We can call any function weâ€™ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. 

Rust doesnâ€™t care where you define your functions, only that theyâ€™re defined somewhere in a scope 
that can be seen by the caller.

RUST function parameters MUST be type anotated!

/* 
* It's important to know the difference between statements and expressions in RUST
* STATEMENTS: do not return a value e.g function defination and variable declaration and
* asignments
* EXPRESSIONS: return a value e.g function calls, calling macros, statements wrapped in curly
* braces
*Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of 
an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
